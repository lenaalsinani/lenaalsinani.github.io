            <strong>Security Service Provider SWE Project</strong>
            <p class="multilineText"> In light of the emerging 2030 vision, many startups and small businesses are experiencing rapid growth.
                 However, due to budget constraints, these companies often find it challenging to establish a dedicated cybersecurity department, 
                 leading to a neglect of crucial data and information security measures. This oversight exposes them to the significant risks of data loss and hacking,
                  ultimately jeopardizing the success of the company. Therefore, we decided to create an application that provides security for small businesses and companies to protect their data with the least cost possible,
                   our goal is to ensure that even companies with limited resources can safeguard their sensitive information.
